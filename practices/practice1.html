<div id="first"> 

<p> So the assignment was to write a couple of paragraphs of text, but chale i cannot think of anything so here goes a poorly punctuated test sentence to start things off. </p>


<p> I am not so sure what to expect, all i know is that this is the beginning of something truly wonderful and i hope i can see it through to the end.</p>

<h5 style="color: green;font-size: 20px; background-color: blue; margin: 0px 400px 0px 400px;" align="center"> This is a completely random image </h5>

<img src="Abeiks.jfif" alt="Abeiks" width="30%" height="120vh" style="margin: 10px 0px 10px 100px;"> 

<h3 style="color: cadetblue; background-color: yellowgreen; margin: 0px 400px 0px 400px;" align="center"> Oh wait, there's more text</h3>




<p style="background-color: grey;"> Apparently, I need to type more paragraphs of text to see if i have truly grasped the basic concept of what was taught. <em> I am not sure what i understand just yet and what i do not understand, all i know is that there is no rest for the wicked. </em> </p>
