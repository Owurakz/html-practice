		This is to a man i used to look up to, herh its insane. the amount of respect i had for this man was crazy, so why is he doing this? to be honest people act different around rich people. why does he keep on doing this?
		</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			For someone with such a brand why does he keep doing this? the term follow back dey tear me cause what is he going to do there? he's always kissing up to his pay masters then disrespects his subordinates. disgusting behaviours
