		<em> So the assignment was to write a couple of paragraphs of text, but chale i cannot think of anything so here goes a poorly punctuated test sentence to start things off. I am not so sure what to expect, all i know is that this is the beginning of something truly wonderful and i hope i can see it through to the end. Apparently, I need to type more paragraphs of text to see if i have truly grasped the basic concept of what was taught. I am not sure what i understand just yet and what i do not understand, all i know is that there is no rest for the wicked. </em>

		Hello, good morning.
		My name is  Owuraku Emmannuel Sintim  an independent researcher with the  Center for Democratic Development. I am writing this letter to determine your best fit for an application for our work study permit program. Brown bears are not always completely brown. Some can be reddish or yellowish. They have very large, curved claws and huge paws. Male brown bears are often 30% larger than female brown bears. They can range from 5 feet to 9 feet from head to toe.

		The brown bear Ursus arctos is native to parts of northern Eurasia and North America. Its conservation status is currently Least Concern.There are many subspecies within the brown bear species, including the Atlas bear and the Himalayan brown bear. The WASCAL Graduate Studies Programme supports and facilitates academic education amongst West African universities in association with German counterpart institutions. The activities focus on the training of doctoral and Master students.

		The Graduate Studies Programme (GSPs) consists of ten (10) Doctoral and two (2) Master’s programmes in Climate Change, and four (4) International Master’s Programme in Energy and Green Hydrogen (IMP-EGH). In all, WASCAL runs ten (10) Doctoral and six (6) Master programmes.

		<h2>Last Paragraph</h2>
		<p>
		Each of the GSPs’ ten (10) Doctoral programmes and six (6) Master’s programmes is autonomous and based at one lead university selected in a consultative process among the candidates’ countries. The GSPs pool the scientific and educational strength of faculties in the West African region and thereby facilitate high quality research and education.

		The IMP-EGH is innovative for the West African region, and it is designed to prepare the next generation to address the energy challenges of adaptation and resilience to Climate Change in West Africa. The programme’s interdisciplinary approach will allow for a better understanding of present-day energy infrastructures in West Africa, their strengths and weaknesses, energy policies, practices in a changing climate context and the search for sustainable solutions.  A significant part of the WASCAL effort is the strengthening of this trans-national communication and capacity building.

		<h4>I added some more sample text</h4>

		<p>
			Recognizing the importance of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in aligning global development efforts, we strive to align our work with these goals. We hope to demonstrate a strong commitment to support the achievement of SDGs that address the environmental dimensions of development, notably SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate change), SDG 14 (life underwater), and SDG 15 (life on land). Our work will also address cross-cutting SDGs, including SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), and SDG 5 (gender equality).
